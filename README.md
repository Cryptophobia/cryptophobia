### Hi there, 👋

My name is Anton. I enjoy learning new programming languages and working on creative ways to solve interesting problems. I love Linux and open source technologies.

When I am not head down at work 💻, you can catch me camping 🏕️, hiking 🥾, or reading a book 📚.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Kubernetes related things.
- 🌱 I’m enjoying learning Golang and getting a degree in cybersecurity.
- 🔧 I'm maintaining a small PaaS project called [Hephy Workflow](https://web.teamhephy.com/). Check it out!
- 💬 Ask me about good music 🎸, beer 🍺, coffee ☕, or tea 🍵!
